# Bounties
In addition to the prizes that teams can win at the end of the hackathon, dapps can create bounties for community engagement on the [Bounties Network](https://berlin.bounties.network/explorer) using the BRLN coin.

If you're participating in the hackathon, and want to participate in these bounties, and win BRLN tokens, browse the available bounties [here](https://berlin.bounties.network/explorer).

## Setting up bounties
The process of creating bounties is outlined [here](https://medium.com/@Sim_Pop/berlin-bounties-network-brln-coin-ethberlin-guide-5ae62f1d346c). You'll need BRLN coins for that, which you can acquire by sending your address to [us](mailto:joinus@ethberlin.com).
