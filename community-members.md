Attendance in the hackathon is limited to participants (hackers, mentors, etc.) only. This is to ensure that the teams will be able to concentrate on their projects. We thank you for your understanding.

BUT, this doesn't mean we don't have anything planned for you. On the contrary, there's a whole week of events planned around ETHBerlin for which we encourage you to [apply](https://blockchainweek.berlin/).

Moreover, on the 7. of September, in addition to the main venue, ETHBerlin is hosting a series of talks and workshops at Factory Mitte (Rheinsberger Stra√üe 76/77) for which you can acquire tickets by making an announcement via [Peepeth](https://peepeth.com) to use the [BlockParty](http://www.noblockno.party) contracts.
