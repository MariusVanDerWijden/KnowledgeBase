### Aragon UI

Aragon UI is an Aragon-native toolkit of UI components for decentralized apps. It will make your app look consistent with the whole look of the Aragon client, in a way that it will not even look like the user is running apps from different developers. However, it is **not** mandatory to create an Aragon app.
