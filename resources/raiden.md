# Raiden

The [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/) is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling low-fee and scalable payments. Raiden leverages payment channel technology, is complementary to Ethereum and works with any ERC20 token. 

A network of payment channels allows to securely transfer value off-chain, i.e without involving the blockchain for every transfer. Not involving the blockchain for every transfer helps avoiding the blockchain consensus bottleneck and makes transfers faster and cheaper.

A payment channel in Raiden is always backed by an on-chain deposit of tokens. When making a payment, the sender signs a balance proof to the respective receiver.

Raiden lets users pay anyone in the network by using a path of connected payment channels to mediate the payment.
