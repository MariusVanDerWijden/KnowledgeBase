# What is Tendermint?

Tendermint Core is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications, Tendermint serves blockchain applications.

More formally, Tendermint Core performs Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) State Machine Replication (SMR) for arbitrary deterministic, finite state machines. For more background, see [What is Tendermint?](https://tendermint.com/docs/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html).

To get started quickly with an example application, see the [quick start guide](https://tendermint.com/docs/introduction/quick-start.html).

To learn about application development on Tendermint, see the [Application Blockchain Interface](https://tendermint.com/docs/spec/abci/).

For more details on using Tendermint, see the respective documentation for [Tendermint Core](https://tendermint.com/docs/tendermint-core/), [benchmarking and monitoring](https://tendermint.com/docs/tools/), and [network deployments](https://tendermint.com/docs/networks/).

# What is Cosmos?

Cosmos is a decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint consensus.

In other words, Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. Before Cosmos, blockchains were siloed and unable to communicate with each other. They were hard to build and could only handle a small amount of transactions per second. Cosmos solves these problems with a new technical vision. In order to understand this vision we need to go back to the fundamentals of blockchain technology.



# What is the Cosmos SDK?



The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well as permissionned Proof-Of-Authority (PoA) blockchains.

# Cosmos SDK Documentation

## Get Started

- **[SDK application tutorial](https://cosmos.network/docs/tutorial/)**: A tutorial to learn the SDK. It showcases how to build an SDK-based blockchain from scratch, and explains the basic principles of the SDK in the process.

## Resources

- [Specifications](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/master/docs/spec/README.md): Specifications of modules and other parts of the Cosmos SDK.
- [SDK API Reference](https://godoc.org/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk): Godocs of the Cosmos SDK.
- [REST API spec](https://cosmos.network/rpc/): List of endpoints to interact with a `gaia` full-node through REST.

## Creating a new SDK project

To create a new project, you can either:

- Fork [this repo](https://github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial/). Do not forget to remove the `nameservice` module from the various files if you don't need it.
- Use community tools like [chainkit](https://github.com/blocklayerhq/chainkit).

## Cosmos Hub

The Cosmos Hub (`gaia`) docs have moved [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/master/docs).

## Languages

The Cosmos-SDK is currently written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), though the framework could be implemented similarly in other languages. Contact us for information about funding an implementation in another language.
