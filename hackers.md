# Hackers
Hackers of the world unite!

## Overview
First things first: In order to participate you need to be admitted to the ETHBerlin, and you need to be physically
present. It's not possible therefore to join in remotely. If you have your consciousness uploaded to the brain of a robot,
please write us and we might make an exception ;)

The hackathon registeration is at 15:30 of the 7th. at the Factory Görlitzer Park venue. Apart from that
you're free to choose one of the venues for the first day, until 21:00. Afterwards, everyone should be
present at the main venue, and the team formation and hackathon kick-off will happen nearly at midnight.
