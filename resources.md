# Resources and Documentation

The following page lists common, useful documentation and resources for your hacks. Sponsors are advised to add their resources and APIs to this document:

## New to dApp development?

If you're new to Ethereum, Web3, and dapp development, you are most welcome here! Below are some resources for you to learn the fundamentals and getting hacking as quickly as possible.

-   [A comparison of Bitcoin with Ethereum](https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ethereum-46dd486ceecf)
-   [Solidity getting started](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) - Solidity is the programming language used for many Ethereum-based dApps, this guide gets you started learning the fundamentals.
-   [ETHHub's conceptual overview](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/what-is-ethereum/) gives you a great introduction of the principles behind Ethereum and Blockchain.
-   Kauri has two collections of content useful for beginners, another [conceptual introduction](https://kauri.io/collection/5bb65f0f4f34080001731dc2/ethereum-101) and [a guide to creating a fullstack dApp](https://kauri.io/collection/5b8e401ee727370001c942e3/full-stack-dapp-tutorial-series) including smart contract concepts, creating a frontend and deploying the dApp.
-   [Superblocks Lab](https://lab.superblocks.com) - Instead of downloading lots of dependencies to get started, this browser-based IDE helps you learn and develop smart contracts and their web frontends. It has a built-in Solidity compiler and EVM, transaction history, and you can export your dApp once you're ready to try other tools.

## Other Resources

-   [ColonyStarter kit](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyStarter) - All you need to get started quickly **building with the Colony stack**. The `colonyStarter` packs in Truffle, Ganache, TrufflePig, and colonyJS into a mono-repo complete with code examples to get going quickly with any dApp project that wants to use Colony's smart-contract infrastructure for task management and reputation. You can learn more about colonyJS and colonyNetwork from the [Colony open-source docs](https://docs.colony.io/).

-   [Parity light.js](https://parity-js.github.io/light.js/getting-started/installation.html) - A high-level reactive JS library optimized for light clients.
-   [Ready to use dApp template](https://gitlab.com/mikiquantum/simple-dapp-calculator) — a clone-and-start-hacking template of a dApp, with CI/CD batteries included. Built with Solidity and React, tested and migrated using Truffle. Brought to you by your [friendly EthBerlin devops mentors](https://gitlab.com/mikiquantum/simple-dapp-calculator/graphs/master)!
