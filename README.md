## Overview

### What is ETHBerlin
We assume, if you're reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin is, but just to recap:

ETHBerlin is a combination of a hackathon, workshops and talks, happening from 7th till 9th of September 2018 in Berlin, Germany.
It's proudly a part of the ETHGlobal community. For more, please refer to the [website](https://ethberlin.com).

## Preparation & Planning
*For everyone*

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps:

### Getting to Berlin
[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a very limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [us](joinus@ethberlin.com).

### Accomodation
There are a variety of options available in Berlin for the purpose of accomodation. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their 
close proximity to the venue.
As part of our commitment to using dapps extensively throughout the hackathon, we're in close contact
with the team behind [Winding Tree](https://windingtree.com/), and most probably they will launch to
mainnet within the next few days, in which case, you can reserve a place with ETH or LIF, their native token.

### Venues
The event will be held at Factory Berlin, which has two venues. The main venue for hackers is
Factory Görlitzer Park (Lohmühlenstraße 65). Registeration starts at 15:30. General audience will
not be admitted to this venue, as we want to allow the teams to be able to concentrate on their projects.

On the first day we will kick things off at Factory Mitte (Rheinsberger Straße 76/77) at 12:00,
and there will be a series of talks and panels throughout the day and until 21:00, in parallel to the hackathon
happening at the other venue. 

Please note that on the next two days, ETHBerlin will continue only at Factory Görlitzer Park, and Factory Mitte is
*only* for the first day.
