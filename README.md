## Usage
We've tried to split the knowledge base into different parts, so that you may find
information relevant to your role, and the stage of the event, easily. Please start
with going through the overview and event which contain general information.

## Overview

### What is ETHBerlin
We assume, if you're reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin is, but just to recap:

ETHBerlin is a combination of a hackathon, workshops and talks, happening from 7th till 9th of September 2018 in Berlin, Germany.
It's proudly a part of the ETHGlobal community. For more, please refer to the [website](https://ethberlin.com).

### Phases
[Preparation & Planning](#preparation-and-planning) | [The Event](#the-event)

### Roles
When you've read the general information for all of the phases above, you may find information
specific to your role here:

[Hackers*](hackers.md) | [Volunteers](volunteers.md) | [Speakers]() | [Mentors](mentors.md) | [Judges](judges.md) | [Sponsors](sponsors.md) | [Community Members]() | [Organization Team]()

*Hacker*: Someone who takes part in the hackathon by joining a team and working on a project, and the term
doesn't exclusively refer to people with software development backgrounds.

### Commitment to Using Dapps
Or "If you liked it then you shoulda put a dApp on it"!

ETHBerlin will try to use tools created within the ecosystem as much as possible for its various needs.
This paves the way for adoption of web3, which we're all trying to buidl, and acts as a good
testing ground for the dapps, consequently helping the respective teams to learn from this experience
and make the softwares even better.
For more on this, check out the [article](https://medium.com/ethberlin/if-you-liked-it-then-you-shoulda-put-a-dapp-on-it-626b032d32a5).

### Communication Channel
One of the dapps, mentioned above, that we love and use a lot, is [Status](status.im/). Make sure you install it
and come say hi in the [#ethberlin](https://get.status.im/chat/public/ethberlin) channel. Feel free to ask for
couches there, or discuss sharing flat with other participants. We also have channels for getting to know eachother
and building teams!

## Preparation and Planning
*For everyone*

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps:

### Getting to Berlin
[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a very limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [us](joinus@ethberlin.com).

### Accomodation
There are a variety of options available in Berlin for the purpose of accomodation. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their 
close proximity to the venue.
As part of our commitment to using dapps extensively throughout the hackathon, we're in close contact
with the team behind [Winding Tree](https://windingtree.com/), and most probably they will launch to
mainnet within the next few days, in which case, you can reserve a place with ETH or LIF, their native token.

### Venues
The event will be held at Factory Berlin, which has two venues. The main venue for hackers is
Factory Görlitzer Park (Lohmühlenstraße 65). Registeration starts at 15:30. Community members will
not be admitted to this venue, as we want to allow the teams to be able to concentrate on their projects.

On the first day we will kick things off at Factory Mitte (Rheinsberger Straße 76/77) at 12:00,
and there will be a series of talks and panels throughout the day and until 21:00, in parallel to the hackathon
happening at the other venue. 

Please note that on the next two days, ETHBerlin will continue only at Factory Görlitzer Park, and Factory Mitte is
*only* for the first day.

## The Event

### Schedule
You may find the schedule of the event [here](https://ethberlin.com/schedule/).

### Food and Stuff
We've got your back, no worries.

### Sleeping Facilities
Due to the regulations of the venue, unfortunately we cannot offer any sleeping facilities on-site, and
sleeping bags are not allowed. Please make sure you take this into consideration when choosing an accomodation.
