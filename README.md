## What is ETHBerlin

We assume if you're reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin is, but to recap.

ETHBerlin is a combination of a hackathon, workshops and talks, happening from 21st till 25th of August 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

Talks and workshops happen between the 21st and 22nd August as part of the [dapp conference](https://www.dappcon.io/) at **The Technical University of Berlin**.

The Hackathon takes place between the 23rd and 25g of August at **Factory Görlitzer Park, Lohmühlenstraße 65**.

It's proudly a part of the ETHGlobal community. For more, please refer to the [website](https://ethberlin.com).

_This repository is information for those of you taking part in the hackathon_.

### What is a hackathon?

There are different types of Hackathon, but the one at ETHBerlin has two purposes:

1.  Competing for sponsor prizes by incorporating their technologies into a project.
2.  Contributing to the broader Ethereum ecosystem with novel or amazing ideas, or contributing to existing projects.

### Help! I've never been to a Hackathon before!

That's fine, you are most welcome here, everyone brings valuable skills to a hackathon. But we're sure you have some questions.

### Do I have to be a developer?

No! In fact, we welcome anyone who brings different skills to a hackathon. Wether you want to help as a designer, project manager, give UX advice, write documentation, or something else. Often the projects that do well at hackathons are the ones that focus on more than just code.

## Preparation and Planning

_For everyone_

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps.

### Getting to Berlin

[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [to us](mailto:joinus@ethberlin.com).

### Accommodation

There are a variety of accommodation options available in Berlin. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their proximity to the venue.

Due to the regulations of the venue, unfortunately we cannot offer any sleeping facilities on-site, and
sleeping bags are not allowed. Please make sure you take this into consideration when choosing an accomodation.

### Tickets

If you are a hacker, mentor, registered sponsor, volunteer, judge or a speaker you don’t need a ticket, just your e-mail confirmation and ID.

Dappcon and other Berlin Blockchain week tickets **are not valid** for the ETHBerlin hackathon.
