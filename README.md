Hacker, looking for a team? Team, looking for an additional hacker?

Prizes
Prizes on Devpost
- Open Track Prize: This is the main prize of ETHBerlin. There will be 10 winners. The grand bounty is of approximately 75.000 € and it’s distributed equally. You can calculate it ;)
- People’s Choice Awards Previous Hackathons have showed that people’s favourite teams were not always among the actual winners. At ETHBerlin, we would like to give those projects a chance by rewarding the people’s favorite team with a community prize of 1000€. The winner will be determined from the top 5 teams through an Olympia prediction market tournament. For details go here. The mentors will vote initially (not on Olympia) to determine the top 5 projects. The top 5 will then be determined through the Olympia prediction market by all of the community as outlined above.

Prizes on Github
- Sponsor Prizes Some of ETHBerlin’s sponsors have their own price awards. They can each pay out a maximum of 5000 €. These prizes will be funded and distributed via Gitcoin. Note that ETHBerlin has no influence on neither the challenge nor the judging, this is entirely up to the sponsors. You can find all the prize awards here.
- Community Improvement Awards These are small prizes endowed with 1000 € each by ETHBerlin. Check them out here.

IMPORTANT: Note that you can submit your work to multiple prize awards, they are not exclusive! So for example you can submit your work to the open track bounty and a sponsor specific prize, just make sure to submit it everywhere where you want to participate.

# OUTDATED BY NOW
## Usage
We've tried to split the knowledge base into different parts, so that you may find
information relevant to your role, and the stage of the event, easily. Please start
with going through the overview and event which contain general information.

## Overview

### What is ETHBerlin
We assume, if you're reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin is, but just to recap:

ETHBerlin is a combination of a hackathon, workshops and talks, happening from 7th till 9th of September 2018 in Berlin, Germany.
It's proudly a part of the ETHGlobal community. For more, please refer to the [website](https://ethberlin.com).

### Roles
When you've read the general information for all of the phases above, you may find information
specific to your role here:

[Hackers*](hackers.md) | [Volunteers](volunteers.md) | [Speakers]() | [Mentors](mentors.md) | [Judges](judges.md) | [Sponsors](sponsors.md) | [Community Members](community-members.md) | [Organization Team]()

*Hacker*: Someone who takes part in the hackathon by joining a team and working on a project, and the term
doesn't exclusively refer to people with software development backgrounds.

### Commitment to Using Dapps
Or "If you liked it then you shoulda put a dApp on it"!

ETHBerlin will try to use tools created within the ecosystem as much as possible for its various needs.
This paves the way for adoption of web3, which we're all trying to buidl, and acts as a good
testing ground for the dapps, consequently helping the respective teams to learn from this experience
and make the softwares even better.
For more on this, check out the [article](https://medium.com/ethberlin/if-you-liked-it-then-you-shoulda-put-a-dapp-on-it-626b032d32a5).

### Communication Channel
One of the dapps, mentioned above, that we love and use a lot, is [Status](status.im/). Make sure you install it
and come say hi in the [#ethberlin](https://get.status.im/chat/public/ethberlin) channel. Feel free to ask for
couches there, or discuss sharing flat with other participants. We also have channels for getting to know eachother
and building teams!

## Preparation and Planning
*For everyone*

We're really excited that you're joining us. Here are the next steps:

### Getting to Berlin
[Here](https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/) you can find information about the airports and stations in Berlin.
Unfortunately ETHBerlin is not able to compensate traveling costs of participants as funding is limited
and we've decided to allocate the biggest fraction of the funds to the prize pool and organizations of
the events itself. However, there is a very limited subsidy on a first-come first-served basis. We encourage
everyone to allow those who benefit most make use of these subsidies. To apply please write [us](joinus@ethberlin.com).

### Accommodation
There are a variety of options available in Berlin for the purpose of accomodation. From hostels to
airbnb flats and hotels. We recommend the regions Treptow, Kreuzberg or Friedrichshain due to their 
close proximity to the venue.
As part of our commitment to using dapps extensively throughout the hackathon, we're in close contact
with the team behind [Winding Tree](https://windingtree.com/), and most probably they will launch to
mainnet within the next few days, in which case, you can reserve a place with ETH or LIF, their native token.

### Venues
Day 1 (7. September) consists of a two-track conference in *two* venues:

- **Factory Mitte** (Rheinsberger Straße 76/77)
- **Factory Görlitzer Park** (Lohmühlenstraße 65)

After the conferences are done, the hackathon people will get together at **Factory Görlitzer** – this will be the *only venue* after the conferences – at 22:00 when the opening ceremony (accompanied by dinner & drinks) and team formation will take place. The Hackathon kicks off at 00:00 on September 8th.

### Tickets
If you are a hacker, a mentor, a registered sponsor, a volunteer, a judge or a speaker you don’t need a ticket, just your e-mail confirmation and ID.

Community tickets for Day 1 conferences will be launched via Peepeth on a Blockparty Smart Contract on September 1st. All tickets are free. Community tickets do *not* enable access to the Hackathon or Day 2 & 3 Workshops. Thank you in advance for respecting the hackers and their #BUIDL.
